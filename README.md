# Hack Technology / Project Attempted

React Native. I followed two tutorials and attempted to merge their concepts into one. Tutorials followed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-S5a0eXPoc and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ_0Fd_N3Mk&t=1305s.

## What you built?

In this assignment, I attempted to build a simple and small shopping app using react native. The app has some items displayed for sale and their prices, and you can scroll over to see more items. The app also has a welcome page where you can find our logo, and navigate to see all productions.

Include some screenshots.

## What you learned and what worked.

What worked was fitting all the images of different sizes in frame, which was hard at first, but after multiple tries and experimenting, it all worked out. Another thing that worked well was putting all my dummy data in a json format, which was then used to read and render all items.

I noticed a lot of similarities with react native and the plain react, such as how everything needs to be wrapped in a view or div respectively

## What didn't work:

Since I followed two tutorials, each only showed how to build screens, styles and render a partiular component, I wanted to find a way to render one component from another one, which didn't work quite right. I plan to research more into this.

In this assigment, I heavily followed two tutorials:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-S5a0eXPoc by Mosh and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ_0Fd_N3Mk&t=1305s by Vadim Savin.

Mosh's tutorial was a pretty cool intro to react native, the styling and building the welcome screen. Vadim's tutorial was super cool to help render items from a json file and allowing scrolling.
